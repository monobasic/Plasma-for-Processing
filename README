I allways wanted to code “Plasma”, a color palette fx seen a lot in Demos of the good old C-64 and Amiga days. 
I didn’t found any good example on the net, but a friend of mine gave me some hints and so I did it. 
The example should be easy to understand, if you have any questions – drop me a line!
You can let it run in your browser with the included java applet.
